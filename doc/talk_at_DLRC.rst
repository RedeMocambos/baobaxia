0. Show Baobáxia on screen, explain that this is software created by the
   Mocambos network. Explain that RM is a collaboration of ~200
   quilombos, ask if people know what a quilombo is, explain. Emphasize
   that this is about traditional communities.
1. Start talking, show Brincadeira Boa in Mercado Sul to set the scene.

3. Tell about Mídia Tática Brasil, Gilberto Gil, pontos de cultura,
   GESAC,

4. Show video GESAC é lento. Allow running to about 2:00, jump to 6:45
   and explain about the education in radio, video, programming, Linux
   etc.
   Talk about how Rede Mocambos work with this in their own tradition:

   * Drums as the first internet
   * Traditional communities as *ancestral* communities, and their adoption of *free* software as a new body of ancestral knowledge alongside pottery, manufacture of manioc flour, etc. 
   * African ways of working, in circles, etc.

5. Show map of the Mocambos network - zoom in on the Tupinambá in
   Olivença, we want to return here.

6. Show video from Kalunga. TC: "Commmunication is a commodity that's
   controlled, because just as some people want to control the land,
   they also want to control communication. That's why we'll construct
   the infrastructure here, because all of us have to be a part of what
   this system can do for everybody. Kalunga has its traditions and it
   needs to have communication to for it to stay alive. Because if not,
   it'll be extinguished (in the pressure of communication from the
   outside), and if it's extinguished, we lose our identity, and if we
   lose our identity, we lose our capacity to recognize each other and
   fight together. And here in the Mocambos network we like to say
   something that Zumbi said, in Palmares: "Vamos fazer um mundo mais do
   nosso jeito." + Layla. Jump to 7:47

7. Explain about Baobáxia and Territorios Digitais Livres. Explain that
   this different way of life is why we need new paradigms.

   * Baobáxia as culture repository, also as communication hub in the community, video, chat, blogging software, etc.
   * Explain how synchronization works - FDT protocol
   * Baobáxia is one example of a software for Free Digital Territories which don't need Internet.
   * Other possibilities for synchronization, task execution, certificates, wiki, blog, transportation service, etc.
   * Ideas?

8. Show slides, starting with "Mucuas" - explain infrastructure

9. Objective is founding a new, millenary African culture in Brazil 

10. Baobab planting ritual when installing Baobáxia

11. Show ritual in "Baobá Tupinambá", ca. 3 minutes

12. Show Espalha Semente as example of how these people really work with
    technology. Tell that now we return to the Tupinambá in Olivença.
    Let it start & run a little, jump to 5:22, let it run to 7, explain

13. Short status of the project - this works, we'd like to improve the
    front end & make it mobile friendly, we'd like to develop the idea
    of Free Digital Territories and write an RFC, maybe a sample
    application, e.g. a bog service.
